# Getting Started

## What is FED

[Moov FED](https://github.com/moov-io/fed) implements an HTTP interface to search [FEDWIRE](https://github.com/moov-io/fed/tree/master/docs/fpddir.md) and [FEDACH](https://github.com/moov-io/fed/tree/master/docs/FedACHdir.md) data from the Federal Reserve Bank Services.

The data and formats represent a compilation of the **FedWire** and **FedACH** data from the [Federal Reserve Bank Services site](https://frbservices.org/).

* [FEDACH](https://github.com/moov-io/fed/tree/master/docs/FedACHdir.md)

* [FEDWire](https://github.com/moov-io/fed/tree/master/docs/fpddir.md)

FED can be used stand alone to search for routing numbers by Financial institution name, city, state and postal code and routing number.  It can also be used in conjunction with [ACH](https://github.com/moov-io/ach) and [WIRE](https://github.com/moov-io/wire) to validate routing numbers.

## Running Moov FED Server

Moov FED can be deployed in multiple scenarios.

- Binary Distributions are released with every versioned release. Frequently added to the VM/AMI build script for the application needing Moov FED.
- Our hosted [api.moov.io](https://api.moov.io) is updated with every versioned release. Our Kubernetes example is what Moov utilizes in our production environment.
- A Docker container is built and added to Docker Hub with every versioned released.

### Binary Distribution

Download the [latest Moov FED server release](https://github.com/moov-io/fed/releases) for your operating system and run it from a terminal.

```sh
$ cd ~/Downloads/
host:Downloads $ ./fed-darwin-amd64
ts=2019-06-20T23:23:44.870717Z caller=main.go:75 startup="Starting fed server version v0.4.1"
ts=2019-06-20T23:23:44.871623Z caller=main.go:135 transport=HTTP addr=:8086
ts=2019-06-20T23:23:44.871692Z caller=main.go:125 admin="listening on :9096"
```

### Docker Container

Moov FED is dependent on Docker being properly installed and running on your machine. Ensure that Docker is running. If your Docker client has issues connecting to the service review the [Docker getting started guide](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/) if you have any issues.

```sh
$ docker ps
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS              PORTS               NAMES
```

Execute the Docker run command

```sh
$ docker run -p "8086:8086" -p "9096:9096" moov/fed:latest
ts=2019-06-21T17:03:23.782592Z caller=main.go:69 startup="Starting fed server version v0.4.1"
ts=2019-06-21T17:03:23.78314Z caller=main.go:129 transport=HTTP addr=:8086
ts=2019-06-21T17:03:23.783252Z caller=main.go:119 admin="listening on :9096"
```

### Kubernetes

The following snippet runs the FED Server on [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/kubernetes-basics/) in the `apps` namespace. You could reach the fed instance at the following URL from inside the cluster.

```
# Needs to be ran from inside the cluster
$ curl http://fed.apps.svc.cluster.local:8086/ping
PONG
```

Kubernetes manifest - save in a file (`fed.yaml`) and apply with `kubectl apply -f fed.yaml`.

## FED data files

The data files included with the Docker image (and in the Fed repository) are **outdated**. This is due to the licensing on the files which prevents us from distributing them.

Moov Fed can read the data files from anywhere on the filesystem. This allows you to mount the files and set `FEDACH_DATA_PATH` / `FEDWIRE_DATA_PATH` environmental variables. Both official formats from the Federal Reserve (plaintext and JSON) are supported.

## Connecting to Moov FED
The Moov FED service will be running on port 8086 (with an admin port on 9096).

Confirm that the service is running by issuing the following command or simply visiting the url in your browser localhost:8086/ping

```sh
$ curl http://localhost:8086/ping
PONG
```

Search for a routing number:

```
$ curl -s "localhost:8086/fed/ach/search?routingNumber=273976369" | jq .
{
  "achParticipants": [
    {
      "routingNumber": "273976369",
      "officeCode": "O",
      "servicingFRBNumber": "071000301",
      "recordTypeCode": "1",
      "revised": "041513",
      "newRoutingNumber": "000000000",
      "customerName": "VERIDIAN CREDIT UNION",
      "achLocation": {
        "address": "1827 ANSBOROUGH",

        "postalCode": "50702",
        "postalCodeExtension": "0000"
      },
      "phoneNumber": "3192878332",
      "statusCode": "1",
      "viewCode": "1"
    }
  ],
  "wireParticipants": null
}
```

Search for a Financial Institution by name:

```
$ curl -s "localhost:8086/fed/ach/search?name=Veridian&limit=1" | jq .
{
  "achParticipants": [
    {
      "routingNumber": "273976369",
      "officeCode": "O",
      "servicingFRBNumber": "071000301",
      "recordTypeCode": "1",
      "revised": "041513",
      "newRoutingNumber": "000000000",
      "customerName": "VERIDIAN CREDIT UNION",
      "achLocation": {
        "address": "1827 ANSBOROUGH",
        "city": "WATERLOO",
        "state": "IA",
        "postalCode": "50702",
        "postalCodeExtension": "0000"
      },
      "phoneNumber": "3192878332",
      "statusCode": "1",
      "viewCode": "1"
    }
  ],
  "wireParticipants": null
}
```
