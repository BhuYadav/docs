Documents are uploaded by clients to help affirm Customer details (address, residency, etc). These are typically drivers licenses, passports, or utility bills.

They should be in a standard PDF or image format. The content type is detected for storage and rendering. Encrypted storage is used according to [environmental variables](https://github.com/moov-io/customers#document-storage) set when running Customers.

Documents can be listed for a user and specific documents can streamed to a browser or downloaded.
