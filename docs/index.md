Financial institutions, businesses, closed-loop payment systems and fintech startups can easily build financial services into apps, platforms and even other financial product offerings.

## Moov ACH

Moov ACH server is a open-source, cloud native ACH payment gateway exposing a RESTful API enabling ACH transactions to be submitted and received without a deep understanding of a full [NACHA](https://www.nacha.org/) file format specification.

## Moov design goals

The core principles underlying Moov are performance, scalability, and ease-of-use. Based on these principles, Moov is designed around the following core features:

- Highly performant (fast)
- Few opinions, lightly held (interoperability)
- Extremely lightweight (small footprint)
- Support client languages (polyglot clients)
- Atomic building blocks ([single responsibility principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle))
