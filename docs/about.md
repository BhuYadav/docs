# About Moov

Moov gives developers an easy way to create and integrate bank processing into their own products. Financial institutions, businesses, closed-loop payment systems and fintech startups can easily build financial services into apps, platforms and even other financial product offerings.

Moov was founded from the frustration of integrating with propriety legacy and SASS financial service providers. The inability and unwillingness to collaborate with third party providers stifles innovation. The atomic building blocks of financial technology shouldn't force proprietary vendor lock-in.

Moov is maintained by [Moov.io](http://moov.io) and an amazing OpenSource EcoSystem, find more at [GitHub](https://github.com/moov-io/).
